# Neural-Network-Julia

A neural network implementation in Julia

# Features

 - Currently, only a binary classifier is implemented

# Requirements

 - Julia 1.3
 - IJulia (for jupyter notebooks given in the `Examples` directory)
 
For GPU support, the following are required (make sure that their tests are passing):
 - CuArrays (tested with v1.7.3)
 - CUDAnative (tested with v2.10.2)
 - CUDAdrv (optional, tested with v6.0.0)

# Usage

TODO

# TODO

 - [ ] Multi-class classification
 - [ ] Custom GPU kernels for activation functions on GPU
